# COVID-19 Data Exploration

This repository houses SQL queries for exploring COVID-19 data from the PortfolioProject database. 

## Overview

The queries delve into various aspects of the pandemic, utilizing SQL skills such as:
- Joins, CTEs
- Temp Tables
- Window Functions
- Aggregate Functions
- Creating Views
- Converting Data Types. 

The primary focus is on analyzing the impact of COVID-19 on different countries and continents.
## Project Goals

The main objectives of this project are as follows:

- Data Exploration: Utilize SQL queries to gain insights into COVID-19 data, examining factors such as total cases, total deaths, infection rates, and vaccination statistics.

- Skill Demonstration: Showcase proficiency in SQL by employing a range of advanced techniques, including Common Table Expressions (CTEs), Temp Tables, and Window Functions.

- Visualizations: Prepare the data for visualization by creating views, facilitating easier interpretation of COVID-19 trends.
## Tools Used

SQL: The primary language used for querying and analyzing data from the PortfolioProject database.
## Project Structure

- Queries: SQL queries are organized to explore different aspects of COVID-19 data, covering total cases, deaths, infection rates, and vaccination statistics.

- Views: Views are created to store data for future visualization, enhancing the accessibility and interpretability of the insights.

- Temporary Table: A temporary table is employed to perform calculations on the partitioned data, providing a structured approach to the analysis.
## Key Findings

The key findings from the data exploration include:

- Identification of countries with the highest infection rates relative to their populations.
- Assessment of the likelihood of death if contracting COVID-19 in specific countries.
- Analysis of continent-wise death counts, providing insights into the global impact.
- Examination of the percentage of the population that received at least one COVID-19 vaccine.

These findings contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the pandemic's impact on different regions and highlight areas that may require further investigation or intervention.
## Acknowledgements
